## Text Mining Solution


This repository contains a text mining solution that processes text files or strings and generates a list of words and their frequency of occurances. The solution includes the following key features:
* Text Preprocessing: The solution performs data preparation tasks such as converting all characters to lowercase, removing punctuation marks, and transforming the text into a word list.
* Word Counting: The solution counts the frequency of each word in the text and generates a sorted list of words from most frequent to least frequent.
* Flexible Data Structures: The solution allows the use of several advanced Java data Structures to store the word frequencies.
* Efficient Implementation: The solution is designed to be efficient, avoiding unnecessary checks and reusing code where possible.
* Readability: I've used full variable names for better readability and maintainability.
